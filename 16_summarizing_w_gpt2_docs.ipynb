Klaus manages to hit Mars and sends Klaus flying across the room. Luck goes around and starts destroying all of the clones. Klaus is still in shock that someone without magic can be so strong. Noelle tells Klaus that Asta's power is negating magic. Klaus thinks that Klaus got lucky getting that power. Mars returns with Heavy Armored Titan and squashes Asta. Klaus asks Asta what Klaus is and Asta tells Klaus that Klaus was born without power and that Klaus is going to be the Wizard King. Klaus jumps and shatters the armor, sending Mars falling to the ground. Yuno remembers when they were children and how Asta kept trying to get through Klaus magic until Klaus succeeded.\"},\n",

Unable to remove the Demon-Dweller Sword, Ladros falls to the ground while his Anti Magic is leaking. Angry, Asta states that Ladros got to where Ladros is now thanks to Ladros friends and that they have boosted each other. Ladros begs for forgiveness and asks Asta to remove the Demon-Dweller Sword, but Asta refuses and intends to knock Asta out. Using his Anti Magic left, Ladros pushes Ladros up and, enforcing Ladros with magic, manages to pull out the Demon-Dweller Sword. Ladros heads to Fana and takes Fana hostage. Ladros forces Fana to unleash Salamander or Ladros will kill Mars. The moment Fana does, Ladros gambles and absorbs the spirit. Successful, Ladros obtains power greater than before. Ladros gets excited about Ladros new powers, stating that the other Eight Shining Generals do not stand a chance and the other Eight Shining Generals could even take the Kingdom. the other Eight Shining Generals attacks Asta with a fast ranged beam, which Asta is unable to dodge. The Witch Queen watches from a distance and uses The Witch Queen Blood Magic to make Asta show The Witch Queen who the other Eight Shining Generals really is. her Blood Magic then comes out and engulfs Asta's right hand.\"},\n",

In a bar, the other captains are having drinks, and Yami Sukehiro teases the other captains that Yami Sukehiro squad placed second.
