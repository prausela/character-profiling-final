Fifteen years later, Asta proposes to Sister Lily, who refuses repeatedly. Yuno and the other orphans criticize Asta and point out his lack of magic. Asta tries to show off his skills, but Yuno outshines him with his magic. Later, at the Grimoire Acceptance Ceremony, a pair of nobles criticize the commoners there. Despite Asta not receiving a grimoire while Yuno attains a four-leaf clover one, Asta challenges Yuno to the title of Wizard King, but Yuno ignores him. After the ceremony, the two nobles ambush Yuno outside the tower, but Yuno overpowers them. All three are then ambushed by Revchi Salik, a former Magic Knight who plans to steal Yuno's grimoire and sell it. Asta comes to Yuno's rescue but fails. As Revchi breaks Asta's spirit, Yuno calls Asta his rival. Motivated by this acknowledgment, Asta decides to keep fighting, which summons a grimoire from the tower. Revchi notices that it has a five-leaf clover, and when a large sword appears from the grimoire, Asta grabs it and the shadow of a devil appears behind him.\"},\n",

Seeing Mimosa healing Asta, Mars is reminded of the Diamond Kingdom's experiments, in which he befriended fellow student Fana and was forced to kill her. Angered, Mars creates another Laevateinn and brings it down on Mimosa and Asta. Klaus Lunettes, Yuno, and Luck Voltia struggle to free themselves from their crystal restraints. In a burst of strength, Yuno manages to break free but then panics as he does not have a spell to stop the giant sword in time. Suddenly, time slows down and Yuno notices a small girl next to him. She yawns and then blows a gust of wind, which shatters Mars' spells and slams him into a wall, defeating him. The others are confused as to what just happened. Asta's new sword then disappears into his grimoire, triggering the collapse of the dungeon. Yuno creates a Heavenly Wind Ark and the Magic Knights gather on it. Asta pleads for them to take Mars, too, but the ceiling collapses and buries the Magic Warrior. Under Luck's direction, the ark reaches the surface. Lotus Whomalt escapes after them having hidden his Bustling Lazy Vehicle and followed the other group; the cart is also carrying the other Diamond mages, including Mars. As the cart flies away, Mars' memories return to him and he thanks Lotus for saving him, while remembering the promise he made to Fana.

Neige asks why Asta saved him and Asta tells him it is because he has not taken responsibility for what he has done yet. Asta starts to hack away at Baro but it just keeps growing back. This leaves him wide open for attack but Theresa saves him from Sally magic. Sally tells Theresa to back off but Theresa tells her to not underestimate old ladies like herself. Marie Adlai tries to make Gauche Adlai go back and help but he is only concerned for her safety. Marie punches him in the face and tells him that it is his job as a Magic Knight to protect everyone. Gauche drops Marie off with Marco outside of the cave and decides to head back and help. Asta is attacking Baro and almost dies but Gauche pushes him out of the way. Gauche tries his magic on Baro but he regenerates too quickly. Gauche gets knocked to the ground and Baro is about to squish him when Asta uses his sword and cuts through his hand. Gauche decides to help protect them. Asta's second sword starts to glow like last time. He cuts through Baro but still, the monster regenerates. Gauche realizes that they have to hit Baro with so many attacks at once that he cannot regenerate. He creates a new spell that allows him to copy other people and makes copies of Asta. All the Astas attack and manage to take down Baro and Sally. Neige cries over Baro's empty clothes. He tells Asta that he is going to take responsibility for both their crimes. Asta tells him that after he is done with that that they can be friends. Suddenly, Neige collapses because he has been hit in the back with magic. Licht is behind the magic and he goes on to attack Asta and Gauche. Asta is saved when Sister Theresa sacrifices herself by jumping in the way of the magical attack. Licht introduces himself as the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun. That is when Asta notices that he has a four-leaf clover grimoire like Yuno.\"},\n",

Yami tells Licht about how he came to Clover Kingdom and how he was made fun of because of his race and culture. In the end, he kicked all of those guys butts and became the boss of the group.

Luck remembers his interactions with his squadmates, while Lufulu remembers the first Wizard King. As the Reincarnation Magic is broken, Lufulu smiles and wishes he could have been friends with humans. Luck stands up and cries, asking if they are all still friends. Magna hugs him and says that they are. The Black Bulls return to their base, with Luck pulling them along with his improved Lightning Magic. They find Gordon Agrippa, Grey, and Henry Legolant sitting among the wreckage of the base. After they relate what happened with Gauche Adlai, Charmy Pappitson approaches the base in a threatening manner. She is not possessed but is furious that someone destroyed her garden. The others blame the Eye of the Midnight Sun and the elves, so Charmy creates a sheep that cooks magic-restoring food. Henry sits separately so he does not drain the others' magic, but Asta invites him over since they can eat more food to make up for any drained magic. Once Henry is able to reassemble the base, he shapes it into a running bull. The Black Bulls head inside and race off to defend the kingdom.\"},\n",

The Magic Knights discuss what to do next. Asta, Luck Voltia, and Leopold Vermillion wish to spar with Gadjah. Lolopechka wants to join the training but trips and falls. Noelle suggests they have a bath since they returned from a long travel to a Grand Magic Zone. Lolopechka, Noelle, Mimosa Vermillion, and Secre Swallowtail decide to go for a bath but a villager rushes in for help, stating that Charmy Pappitson has appeared in the Polnfrume Forest. Finral Roulacase steps in to take care of the situation, but Asta convinces him that he can take care of it. Asta summons the Demon-Slayer Sword and flies off from the castle, while Finral reflects on how much Asta has improved. At Elmora Lake, the women bathe, discuss dating, and also speak on how fortunate they are to have met each other. Elsewhere, Luck and Leopold start sparring with Gadjah. Asta finds a fat Charmy and tries to dissuade her from eating more. Charmy refuses and uses her Cotton Magic and Mana Method to form a giant sheep. Back in the Golden Dawn base, a Magic Knight addresses Yuno as vice-captain and asks his permission to deliver a message from Hage. Hearing this, Yuno gets more eager. In the Polnfrume Forest, Charmy causes more trouble as she gathers all the food from the forest. Potrof feels that he has created a monster and that it is his duty to stop Charmy. However, his Evergreen Vida Valtoria spell merely passes through the giant sheep and cannot stop it. Potrof and Asta team up to go against Charmy, but they fail again and Asta gets stuck in the cotton. Rill Boismortier arrives and freezes the sheep, allowing for Asta and Rill to shatter the cotton. Rill advises Charmy to avoid overeating, and then paints the goddess who saved him while he was possessed by Lira. Asta explains to Rill that it was Charmy who saved him, but Rill refuses to believe it. Yuno flies to Hage and is welcomed by Sister Lily. Ralph recognizes Yuno's resemblance to Lady Ciel and the magic stone that Yuno wears. Sister Lily introduces Ralph to be from the Spade Kingdom. Yuno gets cautious but Ralph sooner convinces that he is not their enemy and tells them about the peaceful past under House Grinberryall's rule before the Dark Triad overtook their kingdom. Ralph states that Yuno is their only hope since he is the heir of House Ginberryall and the Prince of the Spade Kingdom.\"}]"
